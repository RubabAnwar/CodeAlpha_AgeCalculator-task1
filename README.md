# Age Calculator

This project is a simple Age Calculator web application developed as my first task at CodeAlpha as a web development intern. The application allows users to input their birthdate and calculates their age in years, months, and days. It also includes animations and error handling for future dates.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and simple design that is easy to navigate.
- **Date Input**: Users can select their birthdate using a date picker.
- **Age Calculation**: Calculates age in years and months, and provides a message for users who input future dates.
- **Animations**: Character animations display based on the age calculated or if the user is not born yet.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile portrait and landscape modes, as well as tablets and laptops.

## Technologies Used

- CSS
- JavaScript

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the application.
